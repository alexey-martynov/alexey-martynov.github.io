title: Multithreaded Queue in C++

The original article about Multithreaded Queue in C++ i no longer
published. The newer C++ standards include many new facilities that
make the simplest approach correct: r-value references and move
constructors with `noexcept` allow safe and (hopefully) cheap
returning elements by value since C++&nbsp;11 and constructor elision
removes extra constructor calls that might fail since C++&nbsp;17. So
main reason to write the article was gone.
